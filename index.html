<h1> Welcome to the porfolio of the puppy! </h1>
	<h2> Welcome to <br> An Appreciation <br> of the most beautiful <br> and most fun animal in the whole world!</h2> 

	<h3>Fun facts about new born puppies!</h3>

	<p> A puppy is born with their eyes closed they do not open until about 3 weeks.

A puppy does not begin trying to walk until as early as 2 weeks and as late as 5 weeks old They do not automatically know how to walk, they stumble and fall down just like toddlers do.

Out of the 5 senses: touch, taste, smell, hearing and seeing, a puppy first experiences touch.

At about 6 weeks old, a dam will start encouraging her pups to venture out and slowly become more independent.
 
Like human babies, Chihuahuas are born with a soft spot in their skull called the molera, which closes up as they grow.

When you are choosing a puppy from a litter, do not choose the most energetic one and do not choose the one who is the most quietâ€¦Choose one that falls in the middle.

If you have a mixed puppy and do not know what to expect, you can look at his or her feet...Those will large paws most often tend to grow into good sized adults.
