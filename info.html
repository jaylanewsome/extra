		<p>They are born blind, deaf, and toothless.
	A puppy spends about fourteen hours of every day sleeping.
	They develop their sense of smell at the age of three weeks.
	Every year in the United States, more than 5 million puppies are born.
	During the first week of a puppy life, it spends 90 percent  of its days sleeping and 10 percent eating. A lot of growth happens during these first few weeks!
By the age of one, a puppy is considered to be an adult. In human years, this is the physical equivalent of being 15 years old</p>
<p>Out of their five senses, the first sense that develops and becomes utilised in the baby dog is that of touch.


You can get a good idea of the eventual size that your new puppy will become by looking at their feet Large paws may take some growing into, but they're one of the first indications of the ultimate size the dog will reach.


If your puppy bites or nips in play, you can often effectively train them out of this by saying 'ouch!' in a loud voice. This is a similar response to the yelps their littermates make when the same thing happens to them!

Puppies only listen to the initial syllable of a word So if your pup is named 'Princess Pretty Paws' then the only part of the name that your pup will come to recognise is 'Prin!'


Puppies are born without their teeth- their first set of baby teeth start to develop from around four weeks old onwards. But they don't keep them for long at four months old, your puppy will begin to lose his baby teeth and grow his adult set.


Puppies are not born with a sense of smell either Surprising when you consider that the sense of smell is the most utilised sense of the adult dog. Scent glands begin to develop in your puppy at around three weeks of age.


During their first week of life, a newborn puppy will spend up to 90% of it's time asleep.


Puppies may potentially be rejected by their mother if they are born by caesarean section and cleaned before being given back to them, as the dam may be unable to recognise the puppy as their own.


Puppies are most likely to interpret a person smiling at them as a sign of aggression if the person is showing their teeth!
